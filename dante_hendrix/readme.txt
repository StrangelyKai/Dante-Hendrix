-- Read Me --

This project has now been abaondoned, as I am no longer interested in expanding Dante and friends' story.

He now just exists as my first attempt at making a ghost.

I hope you still playing around with him, even if he has minimal content.
(Note, there may be errors and glitches that haven't been fixed, I apologise for them but Dante will likely not be updated anymore.)

-- Old Readme --

Hi! This is the creator Kai here!

This ghosts name is Dante Hendrix, an OC of mine. Over time I'll update him to include more of his story and more info about his friends and family.

Also this ghost was made using the tutorial by the lovely Zarla, heres the link to the tutorial site I used in case anyone is interested in making ghosts of their own: http://www.ashido.com/ukagaka/

I would also like to thank Zi, as well as all the other devs on the Ukagaka Dream Team discord because without them I wouldn't have been able to do this!!

As for me, you can find me on the Ukagaka Dream Team discord! My username is 'kai!!'
I also have a toyhouse, which you can also find the link for in the right-click menu under 'Kai's Socials'

I hope you have a lovely time with my boy!!
